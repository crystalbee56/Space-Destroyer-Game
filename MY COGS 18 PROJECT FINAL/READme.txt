 Here's a brief overview of the game mechanics and structure:

CLASSES:

    SpaceDestroy: This is the main class that initializes the game, sets up the display, manages the game loop, and handles events such as key presses.
    Player: Represents the player's character. It can move left and right within the boundaries of the screen.
    Obstacle: Represents obstacles that fall from the top of the screen. The player needs to avoid these obstacles.
    Bullet: Represents bullets that the player can shoot upwards to destroy obstacles.

INITIALIZATION:

    Pygame is initialized.
    Screen size and colors are defined.
    Sprite groups are created to hold different game elements.

GAME LOOP:

    The main loop runs until the player quits the game.
    It handles events such as quitting the game or pressing keys.
    Updates the game state (positions of sprites, checking collisions, etc.).
    Renders everything on the screen.

COLLISION HANDLING:

    It checks for collisions between the player and obstacles. If a collision occurs, the game restarts.
    It checks for collisions between bullets and obstacles. If a collision occurs, both the bullet and the obstacle are destroyed, and the player's score increases.
    
SCORE DISPLAY:

    The player's score is displayed at the top right corner of the screen.

RESTARTING THE GAME:

    When the player collides with an obstacle, the game is restarted. All sprites (player, obstacles, bullets) are removed, and new ones are created to start a fresh game.

CONTROLS:
    The player can move left and right using the left and right arrow keys.
    The player can shoot bullets using the up arrow key.
    Overall, the game is a simple arcade-style game where the player controls a character to avoid obstacles and shoot them down for points. The objective is to survive as long as possible and score as high as possible.
